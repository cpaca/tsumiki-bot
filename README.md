# tsumiki-bot
discord bot!

If you try to run this code, it won't work because some of the code refers to STATICS.java.
That file has been placed in the .gitignore.
If I don't put that file in the .gitignore, my bot has a GIANT security flaw, on the level of "backdoor my entire bot" levels of security flaw


TODO:

~~Write CommandCore V2, so that 20-30 commands are not done with an if/elseif/elseif/else loop~~ Done!

~~Move code to Github~~ Done!

Write Bot V3, with:

--> Use SlashCommands, now that Discord is making Message Content a Priviledged Intent. (Priviliged? Priveledged? Priviliged? idk)

--> Fix /help so that it doesn't spam 100 messages.

---> (Idea: Make /help **its own CommandCore** that contacts Central?)

--> cats!

--> Update nekosdotlife command

--> Probably outright remove the !cats command

--> Make contacting the owner significantly easier
