# tsumiki-bot
discord bot!

If you try to run this code, it won't work because some of the code refers to STATICS.java.
That file has been placed in the .gitignore.
If I don't put that file in the .gitignore, my bot has a GIANT security flaw, on the level of "backdoor my entire bot" levels of security flaw
